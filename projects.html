                    <h1>Bobile Concept Design</h1>
                    <h2>Context</h2>
                    <p>With the transition towards contactless service as a result of COVID-19, many small owned businesses have suffered immensely from the inability to maintain their customer base with a pre-established mobile order application. In my own local area, family-owned bubble tea shops sit barren in contrast to the lines that used to go out the door. Bobile is an app that attempts to remedy this disparity by providing a personalized mobile ordering service for these bubble tea shops to transform how their customers can order drinks.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Planning</h3>
                    <p>To begin the design process for Bobile, I researched other mobile order services for key features and designs, as the user base would be similar between both applications. After this period of research, I took interest in the level of personalization on Starbuck’s mobile application. Features such as the greeting on the home page and the easy to access Star balance made the user experience on the application more inviting, and the graphical-based Star balance incentivized users to grow their progress to reach the next reward. These were features I incorporated in early wireframes for Bobile.</p>
                </div>
                    
                <div class = "text_goals">
                    <h4>Wireframes</h4>
                    <p>Three main screens were created for the application – a home page where you could navigate the menu and your rewards, a profile page where you could access your personal details, and a cart page where you could review your drinks before placing your order. In my user walkthrough of the application, these were the most commonly accessed screens.</p>
                </div>
                <div class = "mockup"><img src = "imgs/Bobile Wireframes.png" alt = "flat bubble tea UI showcase"/></div>
                <div class = "wireframes_2">
                    <p>The inspiration from the Starbucks application was included in the early designs with a unique modification. Rather than incorporating the linear graphical point system, I decided to use a circular pie-chart point system to better represent that the reward points was a continuous, check-point based cycle rather than a start and finish. This points system within the application was to modernize the old stamp card reward process commonly used by many bubble tea shops. This design would not only automate and simplify the rewards process for the user but also reduce the load for bubble tea shop workers who will no longer have to go out of their way to stamp a card.</p>
                    <p>Being that the user would be navigating the application through a mobile device, steps were taken to ensure that this process would be as seamless as possible. Commonly utilized navigation items such as returning to the home menu, accessing favorited drinks, changing notification settings, and visiting your account were placed on the bottom navigation bar. A fixed button to access the current cart was also placed globally on the bottom right of the screen. These choices were all so that these elements could be easily accessed from the user at any point in the application, making navigation as seamless as possible.</p>
                    <p>Overall, a minimalistic approach was taken. The placement and clarity of elements were carefully balanced so that the user had enough information to intuitively navigate around pages but not so much that they would suffer from information overload.</p>

                    <h3>Final Design</h3>
                    <p>These wireframes were then prototyped in Figma. Many changes and adaptions were made between iterations.</p>

                        <li>Image preview was added to each drink item to help users more easily distinguish between each item in the cart.</li>
                        <li>The ability to quickly remove items from cart was designed.</li>

                    <h3>Reflection and Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>The completion of this project has taught me much about the design process of creating an interface. Taking the personal leap and going into the project after only my first semester learning about user experience design, I had only a conceptual understanding of designing an idea when I began. By going through the process first-hand, experimenting and failing along the way, I’ve come out of the experience with a stronger understanding of how to plan the design of an application, create wireframes for it, and convert those visions into meaningful prototypes. I’m grateful for all these learning experiences.</p>
                    <p>For my next personal project, I hope to learn and incorporate more user research, personas, and user-directed painpoints to focus on into the planning process. These were points I  had limited knowledge in that I wish I had spent more time on with this project, and I feel that if I had incorporated it at an earlier stage, the later processes would have not only flowed smoother but also that Bobile would be completed as a more user-focused project.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>With a time window of just two days, I worked on developing and publishing the Google extension History Terminator. 
                        It is a simple but powerful extension that allows users to quickly and conveniently clear their browser history and caches with a single click.
                        Prioritizing user experience, the extension also features an easy to use minimalistic design that declutters the process of clearing history.
                    </p>
                    <p>History Terminator was a self-lead project with the goal of learning HTML, CSS, the Google Extension API, 
                        and overall, how to develop and publish Google extentions. </p>
