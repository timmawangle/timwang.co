                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Amidst all the changes that COVID-19 has brought upon all our lives this past year, it is clear that mobile orders have grown from a convenience-valued service to a staple part of our everyday lives. While it is fair to say that many companies and businesses have successfully transitioned towards contactless service, it is also true that many small owned businesses have suffered the most from service regulations-specifically ones who lacked an ability to maintain their customer base through mobile order possibilities. This problem inspired me to connect my passion towards creating powerful design solutions towards a service I can speak on.</p>

                    <h3>Challenge</h3>
                    <p>In the time frame of a week, I tackled this challenge utilizing the power of Figma in order to create interface design mockups for a bubble tea mobile order application. I wanted to completely reimagine the process of ordering bubble tea in a modern climate through a minimalistic yet user-friendly interface. In my designs, I paid close attention to concepts of visual hierarchy, mobile-user design, and contemporary aesthetics. I also wanted to preserve the culture of bubble tea by using a modernized color palette adapted from the colors of the Taiwanese flag-bubble tea’s origin country. Overall, I managed to create a multi-screen interface that showcases a possibility of how bubble tea can be ordered through our mobile phones.</p>

                    <h4>Goals</h4>
                    <p>My goal of the project was to not only create a mobile order solution, but to also challenge myself in the shoes of a UI/UX designer. I constantly asked myself questions like what information needs to be presented, what elements are the most important, and how can I manipulate the elements to enrich the experience of the user in both usability and visual design.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>With a time window of just two days, I worked on developing and publishing the Google extension History Terminator. 
                        It is a simple but powerful extension that allows users to quickly and conveniently clear their browser history and caches with a single click.
                        Prioritizing user experience, the extension also features an easy to use minimalistic design that declutters the process of clearing history.
                    </p>
                    <p>History Terminator was a self-lead project with the goal of learning HTML, CSS, the Google Extension API, 
                        and overall, how to develop and publish Google extentions. </p>
